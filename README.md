# Welcome to your GPT Engineer project

## Project info

**Project**: thumbnail-magic-automation 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID/improve

**Description**: Okay, we are going for a complex automation tool. Background story. I like to make Youtube videos, however adding all these information later into the upload, such as descriptions, creating thumbnails, etc. is too time consuming so I would like to see an multi-step automation that could automate the entire upload of the video including all the necessary details Youtube asks before a video can be uploaded. 

That said, let's start with something small, the first of many steps. I would like that when I upload a video to Youtube it would automatically generate a thumbnail and add it to the video. The thumbnail should adhere to the rules of Youtube of what makes a good thumbnail spec-wise. I would like that the thumbnail takes a snapshot somewhere in the video where it could clearly see my face or my body & face and add a simple but captivating caption to it that matches in a small summary what is being mentioned as the title + description of the video.
